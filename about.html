                <h1> Hi, thanks for visiting my site. </h1>

                <p> Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information 
                    about human affairs and terrestrial 
                    events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects.</p>
                <p> It is not a science; there's no evidence that one's zodiac sign actually correlates to personality. 
                    But the system has its own sort of logic. Astrology ascribes meaning to the placement of the sun, the moon,
                    and the planets within 12 sections of the skyâ€”the signs of the zodiac.</p>
                
                <h3> An Astrology Accurately Predicted Hitler's Future.</h3>

                <p> While no one could have known just how horrific Hitler's reign would be, one astrologer came pretty close. 
                    In 1924, a female "fan" of Hitler's gave astrologer Frau Elsbeth Ebertin, 
                    Hitler's birth chart, and she rightly predicted he would become Fuhrer.
                    Hitler himself was said to be a believer in astrology and even consulted with astrological professionals during World War II.
                    Although Hitler was a different kind of leader than American Presidents, 
                    there is certainly a trend of world leaders looking to the stars for some input on their decisions.</p>
